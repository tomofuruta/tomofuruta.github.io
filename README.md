## Classification Problems
### Titanic Survivability

This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. This is a good introductory classification problem as it requires feature engineering. (Based on the Kaggle Knowedge Competition Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)
