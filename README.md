## Classification Problems
### Titanic Survivability (Logistic Regression)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/92ccad383094d6cc6ef313d11be0529b3717319f/Notebook/titanic-classification.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/92ccad383094d6cc6ef313d11be0529b3717319f/Notebook/titanic-classification.ipynb) \
This is a binary classification problem based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. This is a good introductory classification problem as it requires feature engineering. (Based on the Kaggle Knowedge Competition Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)
### Wine Quality (MLP Classifiers)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/0365a7e833e3bd58df21b01f94c57f4abcf16dfe/Notebook/wineQuality.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/0365a7e833e3bd58df21b01f94c57f4abcf16dfe/Notebook/wineQuality.ipynb) \
This is a classification problem that determines the quality value of a given wine based on its features. By using hidden layers, MLP Classifiers are able to determine a non-linear relationship between the features and the target to create a useful and accurate model. 
### Diabetes (KNN)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/1946362869a91805b715b6385de78a18cccc932a/Notebook/diabetesKNN.ipynb)
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/1946362869a91805b715b6385de78a18cccc932a/Notebook/diabetesKNN.ipynb)
This is a classification problem that helps predict if a patient has diabetes based on other medical information. My solution uses a KNN algorithm to create a model that can make a prediction on new data while also giving a step-by-step explanation on how the model works.
## Neural Networks
### Chinese Number Identification (CNN)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/3b5cbc22b5018ccf961a7c98072d6a12989083e6/Notebook/ChineseNumbers.ipynb)
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/3b5cbc22b5018ccf961a7c98072d6a12989083e6/Notebook/ChineseNumbers.ipynb) \
This is an image classification problem that predicts the Chinese number character that has be written in a dataset of handwritten characters, solved using a Convolutional Neural Network. This utilizes a Sequential Keras model with sparse categorical crossentropy.
### Image Classification of Cifar100 (CNN)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/377fb943580b422bc9dbcd855a69af29fb9fbf52/Notebook/cifar100.ipynb) [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/377fb943580b422bc9dbcd855a69af29fb9fbf52/Notebook/cifar100.ipynb) \
This is an image classification problem that predicts the labels of images, solved using a Convolutional Neural Network. Specifically, it is using a Sequential Keras model with categorical crossentropy.
## Recommendation Systems
### Movie Recommendation (Tensorflow)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/92e11284f2a3464728b62cc657ab3751348dbf21/Notebook/MovieRecommendationTensorflow.ipynb)
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/92e11284f2a3464728b62cc657ab3751348dbf21/Notebook/MovieRecommendationTensorflow.ipynb)
This is a recommendation system that can give movie recommendations to a single user based on the interactions of other users and their ratings. It utilizes Tensorflow and Functional API to create a model that recommends through a KNN algorithm.

# Other projects
## Website Development
### [Zen Musubi](zenmusubi.com)
This is a website for a local farmer's market vendor named Zen Musubi, run by Koda Farms. I was tasked with developing a website that would allow users to make online orders for bento boxes that could be picked up at the farmer's market the next week. The website is active and helps the vendor get a couple hundred dollars worth of sales every week.
