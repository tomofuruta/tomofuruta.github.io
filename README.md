# Tomo Furuta Portfolio 
This portfolio compiles all of my personal projects as well as notebooks I created to learn machine learning algorithms.

## Classification Problems
### Titanic Survivability (Logistic Regression)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/92ccad383094d6cc6ef313d11be0529b3717319f/Notebook/titanic-classification.ipynb) \
This is a binary classification problem based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. This is a good introductory classification problem as it requires feature engineering. (Based on the Kaggle Knowedge Competition Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster)
### Wine Quality (MLP Classifiers)
[Github](https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/0365a7e833e3bd58df21b01f94c57f4abcf16dfe/Notebook/wineQuality.ipynb) \
This is a classification problem that determines the quality value of a given wine based on its features. By using hidden layers, MLP Classifiers are able to determine a non-linear relationship between the features and the target to create a useful and accurate model. 
## Neural Networks
### Image Classification of Cifar100 (CNN)
[Github] (https://github.com/tomofuruta/tomofuruta.github.io/blob/377fb943580b422bc9dbcd855a69af29fb9fbf52/Notebook/cifar100.ipynb) \
This is an image classification problem that predicts the labels of images, solved using a Convolutional Neural Network. Specifically, it is using a Sequential Keras model.
